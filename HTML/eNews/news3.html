                        <p> Tom Holland occasionally brings up his sibling in an interview, whether it be to talk about their creative endeavors or to make a joke. While chatting with Collider about his latest film Cherry, he spoke on the fact that his sibling will be making an appearance in Spider-Man: No Way Home. One might automatically assume that Holland was the one who went to director Jon Watts to get his brother a role in the newest Spider-Man film. However, it turns out the situation played out in a different way: </p>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That was an idea we had, we were having a barbecue at my house within the first few weeks of shooting. Mr. Watts was there and Harry kind of put it on him and said, 'Listen, Jon, I've been here since the beginning, when are you going to put me in this film?’. And Jon had the perfect idea, that was making him a bank robber and then I have to catch him, which is a lot of fun.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p> Okay, so it goes without saying that being Spider-Man’s brother would come with some perks, but I don’t think anyone expected that having casual backyard barbecues with famous directors would be one. That’s pretty a pretty awesome bonus and, once you add in the film cameo, the cool factor is almost too much to handle.
