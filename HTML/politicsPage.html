                    <h2>• Factor In Anambra Governorship Election</h2><br>
                          <p>The absence of elected council executives and legislative councillors in local councils across the state has assumed a worrisome state. Piqued by the development, President Muhammadu Buhari was recently said to have ordered the sacking of all such unelected officials.</p><br>

                            <p>Investigation by The Guardian revealed that the use of non-elected officials to run the affairs of local councils in states had gradually become a part of Nigeria’s political system, especially given the reluctance of state governors to support the election of council executives.</p><br>
  
                            <p>This practice, which has not only become an aberration of law, could be linked to the abysmal state of the third tier of government, where governors have appropriated the councils as sources of quick political intervention funds.</p>
                    <div class="items-1"></div><br>
                        <p>Analysts have aptly described the ugly state of affairs at the grassroots as unconstitutional, null and void, stressing that it has greatly devalued Nigeria’s democracy. Practically, the development violates Supreme Court’s judgement of 2016, which voided laws enacted by states’ Houses of Assembly that empowered governors to sack elected chairmen and councillors, only to replace them with caretaker committees.</p><br>
  
                        <p>At the last count, about 10 states, namely, Anambra, Ogun, Oyo, Sokoto, Kwara, Imo, Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto and Edo, have so far failed to conduct elections into the councils. For many years, indigenes and residents of the affected states have been denied opportunity of local council administration by elected representatives, as guaranteed by the Constitution.</p><br>
  
                        <p>The governors, a handful of whom are in their second term in office, have not deemed it fit to conduct the poll after several promises to the electorate, leading to general loss of confidence in the system. The few, who had opportunity of conducting election in their first term, refused to conduct another, after the last elected councillors and chairmen served out their tenures. Political watchers aver that this undemocratic system runs contrary to the spirit of Section 7 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), which guarantees the conduct of elections in 774 councils of the federation.</p><br>

                        <h2>Feeble Censure</h2><br>
                        IN 2012, the House of Representatives came heavily on erring state governors, with an order to immediately conduct the elections. A motion, which was also raised by the legislators to suspend the release of allocation to such local councils, was however later annulled, as it was described as unconstitutional.
                <div class="items-1"></div><br>
                       <p>The sponsor of the motion, Friday Itulah, claimed that the system of appointing caretaker committees to head the councils is alien to Nigeria and a violation of Section 7(1) of 1999 Constitution. He warned that if the practice by the erring governors was not checked, it might bring the country to a lawless state. Based on the foregoing, observers said they had expected the affected governors to swing into action and set up machinery for the conduct of a free, fair and credible poll to fill vacant spaces in the third tier of government in their various states.</p><br>
  
                       <p>But, while some states recently conducted the poll, others, which include a handful of those serving their first term, like Ogun, Oyo are undeterred in their determination not to conduct the council polls. It would be recalled that for seven years the immediate past administration of late Governor Abiola Ajimobi, tinkered with the promises of conducting council polls without any positive result.</p><br>
  
                       <p>Some opposition parties and social critics have severally alleged mismanagement of funds as chief reason why some governors prefer to run council administration with appointees. But, there are reports of some states, where council elections held, yet the state chief executive pressured the elected council executives to divert funds.</p><br>

                       <p>Last year, the National President, Association of Local Government Vice Chairmen of Nigeria (ALGOVC), Lawrence Onuchukwu, told newsmen that the erring governor used unelected council officials as conduit pipes to siphon monies allocated to the councils.</p><br>
